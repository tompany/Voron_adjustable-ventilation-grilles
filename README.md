#Voron 2.4 ajustable ventilation grilles

These are some simple ventilation grilles that can be put in the doors and sidepanels of your Voron printer. I made them for my Voron 2.4r2, but they can also be used for other Voron models.

With these grilles you can create an airflow over the building plate. Therefore they should be mounted with the holes just above the buildplate.

The grilles are in Voron style with 6 sided holes and when they are shut the Voron Logo is visible.

There are 5 STL files:
1. Grill Front (for M3 cone head screws).stl
   - You can only use these for the front doors. In the sidepanels the nuts will be in the way for your Gantry.
2. Grill Front (for M3 heat inserts).stl
   - Put M3 heat inserts in the holes
   - Use cone head bolts and drill holes with a cone shaped countersunk edge on the inside.
3. Grill Back.stl
4. Grill Sliding Shutter.stl
5. Grill Drilling Jig.stl
   - Use this drilling jig to mark the exact spots of the holes to drill in your panels. (See picture below.)

Colours:
- RED for the Front and back
- BLACK for the sliders
